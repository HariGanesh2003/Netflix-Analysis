Most content is rated TV-MA (841 titles) and R (575 titles), meaning much of Netflix’s catalog targets mature audiences.

Comedy and Drama are the most frequently top-rated genres, with comedy leading in IMDb scores.

Documentation, drama-comedy blends, and similar mixes also rank high.

The Gift, Erased, and Cowboy Bebop are among the top 25 titles by IMDb rating, with The Gift rated highest at 22.2.

## Growth and Decline:

Number of titles increased steadily each year, peaking around 2020-2021.

There is a sharp decline in new titles added after 2021, possibly due to changing strategies or external factors.

Tapering off after the peak years suggests market saturation or content policy shifts.
